\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Please design a method (algorithm) to realize privacy-utility tradeoff in data publishing\
\'95 For the given dataset Bank, there are Two special attributes among 14 attributes, i.e., the "job", and the "housing". One application scenario is that this dataset will be published for social research, where the value of attribute " job ", " housing " of each individual is unknown. To design a set of advertisement plans, the researchers from human resources are expected to predict the value of " job " as accurate as possible. However, due to the sensitivity of attributes " housing ", the researchers from human resources are expected to predict those two attributes as inaccurate as possible\
\'95 Considering you are the data publisher, you are required to inject noise (any type of noise you want, not limited to differential noise) to this dataset prior to publishing.\
\'95 The object is clear: the researchers are expected to predict the value of " job " as accurate as possible (this is utility); however, predict " housing " as inaccurate as possible (this is privacy).\
\'95 The performance of your method will be evaluated by the tradeoff between privacy and utility. For example, utility/privacy\
\'95 Hint: do not forget data dependency.}
